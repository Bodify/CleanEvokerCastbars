# CleanEvokerCastbars
**CleanEvokerCastbars** is a simple lightweight addon that changes the weird evoker castbars to normal ones so you know if you can kick or not.

It changes all nameplate castbars, Target & Focus castbars and it also changes **sArena** castbars if you are using **sArena**.

No extra castbars are created, it's only editing the default ones.
